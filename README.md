# CENG140 - C Programming Projects

This repository contains two assignments developed for the CENG140: C PROGRAMMING course at Middle East Technical University (METU). The projects focus on practicing core C concepts such as string manipulation, pointer arithmetic, dynamic memory allocation, and modular design.

---

## Assignment 1 ‚Äì Gene and Protein Matching (`the1.c`)
Simulates the translation of a DNA sequence into RNA and checks whether a given protein sequence matches the genetic data after splicing introns. Implements codon-based conversion logic and verifies the match under biological constraints.

**Topics Covered:** String slicing, function design, conditionals, codon-to-amino acid mapping, biological sequence simulation.

---

## Assignment 2 ‚Äì Dynamic Hash Table (`the2.c`)
Implements a custom hash-based storage system using a two-level dynamic array. Includes functionality to insert encoded names, resize arrays, and expand the index area based on usage thresholds. Mimics a basic hash table with collision handling via dynamic arrays.

**Topics Covered:** Pointers, dynamic memory allocation (`calloc`, `realloc`), hash indexing, data structure expansion, modular functions.
